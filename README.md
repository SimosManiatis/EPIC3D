The script EPIC3D_3DCGAN_APRIL2024.py is designed to process 3D object files, specifically in the .obj format, using deep learning techniques to generate and manipulate 3D voxel grids. 
It employs a 3D Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (3DCGAN) architecture that consists of a generator and a discriminator, both defined as neural network models. 
The script initializes these models and trains them using voxelized versions of the input 3D models. During training, the generator attempts to produce voxel grids that resemble the real 3D data, 
while the discriminator evaluates them against the actual data to determine their authenticity.

The script includes functions for loading and checking 3D meshes, converting them to voxel grids, and transforming these grids into PyTorch tensors for processing by the neural networks.
The training process involves alternating updates to the discriminator and the generator, with the discriminator being trained to distinguish real data from data generated by the generator,
and the generator being trained to fool the discriminator. The results of the training are visualized using the Visdom visualization tool, and the script is set up to handle device optimization
based on whether CUDA is available, indicating GPU support.

Additional utility functions in the script facilitate the conversion of voxel grids back to point cloud data, and the saving of these point clouds in the .ply format. The overall aim of
the script is to refine the process of generating realistic 3D voxel representations of objects, which can be used in various applications such as virtual reality, gaming, and 3D modeling.
